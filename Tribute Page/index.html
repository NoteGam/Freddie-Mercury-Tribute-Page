            <p>Is this the real life?</p>
            <p>Is this just fantasy?</p>                               
            <p>Caught in a landside,</p>                   
            <p>No escape from reality</p>
            <p>Open your eyes,</p>
            <p>Look up to the skies and see,</p>
            <p>I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,</p>
            <p>Because I'm easy come, easy go,</p>
            <p>Little high, little low,</p>
            <p>Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to</p>
            <p>Me, to me</p>
            <br>
            <p>Mamaaa,</p>
            <p>Just killed a man,</p>
            <p>Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,</p>
            <p>Now he's dead</p>
            <p>Mamaaa, life had just begun,</p>
            <p>But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>
            <p>Mama, oooh,</p>
            <p>Didn't mean to make you cry,</p>
            <p>If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,</p>
            <p>Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters</p>
            <br>
            <p>Too late, my time has come,</p>
            <p>Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all</p>
            <p>The time</p>
            <p>Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,</p>
            <p>Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</p>
            <p>Mama, oooh</p>
            <p>I don't want to die,</p>
            <p>I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I see a little silhouetto of a man,</p>
            <p>Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me</p>

            <br>
            <p>I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me</p>
            <p>He's just a poor boy from a poor family,</p>
            <p>Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
            <p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go</p>
            <p>Bismillah! No, we will not let you go</p>
            <p>(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go</p>
            <p>(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go</p>
            <p>(Let me go) Will not let you go</p>

            <p>For meee</p>
            <br>
            <p>So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye</p>
            <p>So you think you can love me and leave me to die</p>
            <p>Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,</p>
            <p>Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here</p>
            <br>
            <p>Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,</p>
            <p>Nothing really matters,</p>
            <p>Nothing really matters to me</p>
